    We removed all optimizations that are infrastructure-dependent, e.g.
    parallelized model inference on multi GPUs,
    parallelized DD+AR on multiple CPUs,
    parallel execution of LM and DD+AR,
    shared pool of CPU workers across different problems, etc.

    Many other speed optimizations and abstractions are also removed to
    better present the core structure of the proof search.

    Args:
      model: Interface with inference-related endpoints to JAX's model.
      p: pr.Problem object describing the problem to solve.
      search_depth: max proof search depth.
